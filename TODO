- physical memory rework:
  - lazily allocate all physical RAM at startup
  - custom allocator that supports alignment, resizing, upper/lower split
    -> implement corresponding DPMI functions
  - programs assume that lower memory can be accessed via default flat selector - either
    allocate virtual memory as close to zero as possible, or apply hidden offset to all
    selectors
  - translation from/to block-internal addresses (encourage inlining!)
    -> needs to take selector / segment base into account!
  - map executable image into that region

- cleanup:
  - avoid conversions between enums
